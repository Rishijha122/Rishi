                <h3>About the Book</h3>
                <p>
                    Atomic Habits is a book by James Clear that focuses on the power of small, incremental changes to improve our lives. The book is divided into three parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The first part of the book is about the science behind habits and how to
                            change them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The second part of the book is about how to apply the science to your life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The third part of the book is about how to create a system that will help
                            you achieve your goals.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been reading Atomic Habits by James Clear for the past few weeks. It is a
                    book that has really resonated with me. I have been trying to improve my habits and I
                    have been using the book as a guide. I have been trying to make small changes
                    to my habits and I have been seeing the results. I have been able to
                    eat healthier,
                    exercise more, and I have been able to get more done in less
                    time.
                    I have been able to
                    make a positive impact on my life and I have been able to
                    achieve my goals.
